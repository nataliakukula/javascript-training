// sort these number by hand:
// 201, 39, 54, 461, 93, 377, 413, 176, 164, 317, 109, 113, 36, 235, 17, 60, 53, 474, 257, 48

//how would you sort this by hand?
// I'd look for the smallest number and put it in front...
// I'd find the next smallest number and put it in the spot behind the first number...
// -> you're describing an algorithm, and there is no right way to do it
// -> and efficiency is the question

// you do a selection sort that is the O(n2)
